## The Copypasta

"Bro come on bro wtf everybody knows weird is spelled weird bro! con on bro wtf it's okay though I don't want to hurt your feeling bro but rather tell you gently of your error before others more hostile than I come forth to reprimand you for your mistake! And bro! Lest you forget, many others have made a similar mistake in the past. In fact I'd say the mistake has been made many times! Just remember bro that it is 'I' before 'E' except after 'C' and except in that one word that is kind of WEIRD (the hint here is that the "kind of weird" word is in fact the word weird!) carry on bro but still wtf come on man"

## Enhancement

- Look into Snoostream for comment stream usability instead of attempting to query comments
  - 2 functions, 1 does the title checker, one does the comments
    - title checker runs every minute
    - comment stream constantly runs till turned off
- Look into running this on a raspberry pie server running in the house
